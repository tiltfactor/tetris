Tetris
======
This is a modified version of Steven Lu's HTML tetris.

It includes:

 - Tetris code modified to record session data
 - the PHP server, which receives and stores the data
 - a HTML/JS parser for the session data
   - Note: the parser has not yet been implemented

The session data is stored in a JSON format.
