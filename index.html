		<h1>Tetris</h1>
		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<p>
			In Tetris, you are trying to arrange the falling blocks to fill each row completely.
			You may move and rotate each piece as it falls. When it reaches the bottom (or another piece)
			it will stay there, and another piece will start to fall. The box to the right of the board
			displays the next piece. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When a row is completely filled, it will be removed from the board. Clear 20 lines to win!
		</p>
